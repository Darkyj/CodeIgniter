This project was an advanced CodeIgniter assignment that my class had to do. 

The purpose of this assignment was to build a simple website that had a login and registration with validation. As well as a message wall that individuals with accounts could post on their own walls as well as reponses to other people's messages.

There is a bit of this that I have not yet finished which I plan on coming back to. 

The part remaining is the wall. The wall currently not functional as I had to move on. I had previously built the wall in a previous assignment, so the only job that needed to be done is to incorporate that assignment into this one.
